	Coffee beans are grown on a tree called a coffee plant, which is a tropical plant that loves
	shade. Coffee plants flower only once during their life, and coffee beans are harvested from
	the seeds found Inside the coffee cherry that grows from the flower. Brazilian coffee cherries
	are red and delicious. Coffee Is harvested when the coffee cherry turns yellow or golden.

	most common methods Include beating, picking and strip picking. Beating Involves a
	machine shaving the fruit off the tree, while picking means harvesting the coffee cherries by
	hand. Finally, strip picking Is a combination of beating and picking where the machine
	shaves the cherries first, then people pick the coffee beans from the shavings
